# Night Vision Glasses

Or goggles, but the textures (thank you to CursedFlame for allowing me to edit their glasses texture and sub-license it under the terms of the MIT license).

These goggles can be used to toggle on and off Night Vision and 'Mob Vision' (makes mobs glow in a radius around you).

With one of the effects active, every so often the goggles will take damage. With both effects active, they will take even more damage.

They can be repaired with night vision potions & golden carrots.
